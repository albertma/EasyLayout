# EasyLayout

### Overview

EasyLayout is my experimental framework for performing quick layout of views.  It is the goal of this framework to compete with AutoLayout, which I beleive is ideal for laying out views in code.

My thesis is that this framework used in conjuction with `layoutSubviews` will take less code, and be more powerful than what AutoLayout is capable of.

Although it is in a rudimentary state, it is quite powerful as is.

### TODO

* Provide sample project illustrating it's use.
* Improve documentation
* Finish the framework
