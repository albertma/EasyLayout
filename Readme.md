# EasyLayout

### Overview

EasyLayout is my experimental framework for performing quick layout of views.  It is the goal of this framework to replace AutoLayout, which I beleive is awful for laying out views in code.

My thesis is that EasyLayout, used in conjuction with `layoutSubviews`, will take less code and be more powerful than what AutoLayout is capable of.

Although it is in a rudimentary state, it is quite useful as is.

### TODO

* Provide sample project illustrating it's use.
* Improve documentation
* Finish the framework
